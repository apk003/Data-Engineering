Reads from a PostgreSQL database created in pgadmin, then it writes to a hive table.

## TDSPipeline / WriteToPostgreSql
Looks at Minneapolis traffic stop data to identify a racial bias in policing. 

Though not altogether in one scala class, this is really a pipeline taking local csv data, sending it to a database, then retrieving it for Spark analysis.
